# DeepLearning.AI Assessment - Training Loop For a Binary Classifier Network

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook for implementing a training loop for binary classification using a neural network, as part of the assessment for the Curricum Engineer opening.  

The environment is containerized using **Docker**, for an easy execution. 

## Steps to Run the Application

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Linux/macOS) and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dataversenomad/curriculum-engineer-assessment.git
```

### 2. **Run the container to start Jupyter Lab Server**

Once you have the repository cloned, navigate to the project folder where the Dockerfile and requirements.txt are placed, and build the Docker image using:

```bash
docker build -t dlai_assessment .
docker run -p 8888:8888 dlai_assessment
```

Once the container is up and running, you will see output in the terminal similar to this:

```
The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=<some_token>
```
Here, <some_token> is a security token generated by Jupyter Lab when it starts. This token will be printed in the terminal output whenever you run the container.

### 3. **Open Jupyter Lab**

Next, open your web browser and go to the following URL:

http://localhost:8888/?token=<some_token>

### 4. **Run Jupyter Notebook**

Once you are inside Jupyter Lab, navigate to **"01 - NN - Implement a training loop for binary classification.ipynb"** and run the notebook.

You can now interact with the notebook.

### 5. **Clean up**

After you are done using the application, you can stop the running Docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```
you can obtain the container_id by executing

```bash
docker ps
```

To remove unused Docker images and containers, you can clean up your Docker environment by running:

```bash
docker system prune
```
