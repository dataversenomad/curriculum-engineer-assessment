# DeepLearning.Ai - Training Loop for Binary Classification using a Neural Network

Welcome to the DeepLearning.Ai **Training Loop for Binary Classification using a Neural Network**. In this project, you will build a training loop for a neural network to solve a classification problem in machine learning. You will use a Jupyter notebook to complete this task. Everything is containerized using Docker for easy setup and execution on both **Windows** and **Linux** platforms.

Please follow the steps below to complete the task. Once you finish your work, you will need to build the Docker image to share your solution.

## Steps to Run the Application

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Linux/macOS) and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dataversenomad/curriculum-engineer-assessment.git
cd curriculum-engineer-assessment
```

### 2. **Build the Docker Image**

Once you have the repository cloned, navigate to the project folder where the **Dockerfile** and **requirements.txt** are located. Before executing the command below, **make sure Docker is up and running on your machine**. Once Docker is ready, you need to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t dlai_ce_assessment .
```
Building the image might take around 1 to 5 minutes, depending on your system's performance.

### 3. **Run the Docker Container**

Next, run the Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 dlai_ce_assessment
```

Once the Docker container is up and running, the URL for the Jupyter notebook will be printed in the terminal output, similar to the next output:

[C 2025-03-16 14:05:59.289 ServerApp]

    To access the server, open this file in a browser:
        file:///root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-1-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8888/lab?token=<token_id>
        http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=<token_id>


Here, <some_token> is a security token generated by Jupyter Lab when it starts. This token will be printed in the terminal output when you run the container, and you will only need to **copy + past**e the generated URL into your web browser to access the Jupyter Notebook interface.

### 4. **Work on the Notebook**

Once you're inside Jupyter Lab, locate the notebook **01 - NN - Implement a training loop for binary classification.ipynb** and begin working on the exercise.

- Follow the instructions in the notebook and complete the assessment.
- The notebook may contain tasks, comments, and hints to guide you through the process. Please, be sure to interact with the code and experiment with it as needed!

**At this point, please do not close the Jupyter Lab application** that is currently running inside the Docker.

### 5. **Clean up**

After you're done with your **submission**, you can stop the running Jupyter notebook by going back to the original terminal and pressing **Ctrl + C**. Otherwise, if you prefer to stop the Docker container, use the following command (you can obtain the container_id by running **docker ps**):

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

To remove unused Docker images and containers, clean up your Docker environment by running:

```bash
docker system prune
```
